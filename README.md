# Description
Our game is based off of the Flash game AZ Tanks. In this game, the objective is to control a tank that can shoot bullets in order to eliminate all opposing tanks. The map that you and your enemies are spawned in is randomly generated. It is a maze with walls that you cannot pass through. The bullets are able to bounce off walls. Thus, you want to dodge existing bullets while also approaching and shooting bullets at your enemies. You can be damaged by your own attacks, but NPCs cannot be damaged by their own attacks. It will be a 1-2 player game in which you can play against someone else and even add up to 3 NPC (non-playable characters) enemy tanks. In addition, there will be power-ups that spawn on the map in regular intervals. These power-ups can modify the base attack of your tank, giving you an advantage. The goal of this game depends on whether you are playing on the single-player or two-player modes. For the single-player mode, the goal is to survive as many rounds as possible, with each round defined by a new maze and respawned enemies. You lose when your tank is eliminated and win each round when all enemies are eliminated. For the two-player mode, the goal is to beat your opponent. Whoever reaches 5 wins first is the victor. If a round is completed with no players alive (only NPCs remain), there is a tie.
